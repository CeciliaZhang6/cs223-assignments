= Hardware specifications

Where did your run your tests? A laptop, or goldengate?

I used goldengate.

What are the performance specifications of the machine: number and speed of
processors, size of RAM? (use `lscpu` and `free -m`)

- 8 CPU (CPU max MHz: 4700.0000, CPU min MHz: 800.0000)
- RAM: 31932 mebibytes in total
